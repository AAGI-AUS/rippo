The goal of rippo is to ease data entry and tracking of AAGI-CU Intellectual Property and Project Outputs for reporting purposes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rippo like so:

```r
o <- options() # store default options

options(pkg.build_vignettes = TRUE)

if (!require("pak"))
  install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("AAGI-AUS/CBADASReml")

options(o) # reset options
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```r
# create a Word document of IPPO tables from each of the project's registers

library(rippo)
create_ippo_tables()
```
