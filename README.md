The goal of {rippo} is to ease data entry and tracking of AAGI-CU Intellectual Property and Project Outputs (IPPO) for reporting purposes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {rippo} like so:

```r
o <- options() # store default options

options(pkg.build_vignettes = TRUE)

if (!require("pak"))
  install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("AAGI-AUS/rippo")

options(o) # reset options
```

## Using {rippo} for generating your project IPPO reports

{rippo} includes a Shiny web app to make interfacing with the IPPO tables simpler.
Once {rippo} is installed you can run the web app like so:

```r
library(rippo)
run_IPPO_app()
```

The app currently has the following features:

- Add background IP by specifying the relevant details,
- Add background IP from a catalog of frequently-used IP,
- Add outputs and specify links between outputs and background IP,
- Add correspondence related to outputs,
- Load an existing IPPO registry,
- Edit and delete existing entries, and
- Export resulting IPPO in .xlsx format.

### The background IP catalogue

The current catalog contains a selection of IP from a small number of AAGI projects.
We do not expect this is a complete list of the frequently used IP.
If you believe there is IP that is used frequently by yourself and others and should be added to the catalog, submit an issue with either:

- the package name and relevant language, or
- the relevant information for the IPPO table.

### Limitations on IPPO upload

While the uploader works well on IPPO files generated using the app, older files that do not conform to the same structure can run into issues.
When uploading your existing IPPO register, be aware of the following restrictions (this list may change as further development is undertaken).


- If the description of background IP in the imported document does not match *exactly* any of the descriptions in the catalog, it may be identified as a novel piece of IP.
This can be confusing for packages where the name may be the same but they are identified as different due to discrepancies in the description.
If you specify the name of the background IP in curly braces followed by a space at the start of the description (_e.g._, `{BIPName} Description of BIP.`), the uploader will recognise this as a name for the background IP and will check that against the existing records as well.
We recommend avoiding the use of curly braces for other purposes in the background IP descriptions.

- Dates are expected to be formatted as date objects in Excel.
If stored as text (or other) data types, this may cause issues upon loading.

- The links between outputs and background IP are expected to come as `Table X, Lines Y` where `X` is the relevant table and `Y` is a list corresponding to the rows in that table.
By default the app will save this as a list of comma separated integers (_e.g._, `Table 1, Lines 1,2,3,4,8`), however for the purposes of reading in files it will recognise collapsed lists using colons and hyphens (_e.g._, `Table 1 Lines 1:4, 8` and `Table 1 Lines 1-4, 8`).
Other ways of specifying this list will not be identified.

## Using {rippo} for generating whole IPPO registers for reporting

{rippo} includes two functions that are used to generate a unified Word document of the IPPO.

1. `list_ippo_tables()` and
2. `create_ippo_report()`.

The former, `list_ippo_tables()`, creates a nested list object of all the IPPO tables from each project that is ordered by project code and Tables 1-5 (excluding any tables that do not have data entries).
The latter, `create_ippo_report()`, takes the nested list of all IPPO tables and generates an MS Word document output for reporting to GRDC.
This function allows for providing an existing MS Word document and appending values to it.
This is useful where, as is the case for Curtin, an overarching IPPO register exists for AAGI-CU project IP and outputs that do not fall into service and support projects, upskilling and awareness projects or research and development activities.
This overarching document can be read in and the remainder of the individual project IPPO details can be both read in and appended in project order and saved to the GRDC Box folder for reporting like so.

```r 
# for macOS with GRDC Box synced locally
library(fs)
sp <- "CU" # strategic partner for report
R_drive <- "/Volumes/dmp/A-J/AAGI_CCDM_CBADA-GIBBEM-SE21982/"
ippo_doc <- "~/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/AAGI-GRDC/AAGI IPPO Register/AAGI-CU-IPPO Register.docx"

tl <- list_ippo_tables(
   dir_path_in = path(R_drive, "Projects"),
   sp = sp
 )

create_ippo_report(tables_list = tl,
                   infile = ippo_doc,
                   outfile = ippo_doc,
                   sp = sp)
```
